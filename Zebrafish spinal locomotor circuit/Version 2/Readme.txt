Directory for code for models for zebrafish spinal locomotor circuits

This code is the new version (January 2022) of the models decribed in Roussel et al. 2021 published in eLife.

This version was created by Emine Topcu Can who has improved the structure of the code for ease of use. Many of the common procedures have now been defined as functions such that any changes to the base model such as silencing of spinal populations does not require repetition of most of the base model. 

A few minor mistakes were corrected, which required minor changes in synaptic weights, particularly in the double coiling model.
