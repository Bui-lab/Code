Directory for code for models for zebrafish spinal locomotor circuits

This code was the version used for Roussel et al. 2021 published in eLife.

A new version can be found in the folder Version 2.  In this version, the structure of the code has been improved. Many of the common procedures have now been defined as functions such that any changes to the base model such as silencing of spinal populations does not require repetition of most of the base model. 

A few minor mistakes were corrected, which required minor changes in synaptic weights, particularly in the double coiling model.
